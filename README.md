# EXP|CON - Fictional project for test assessment

The purpose of this project is test the creator's skills in Frontend web development, using Javascript/Typescript skills such as React.js and micro frontends to build a full application from scratch.

The application was developed with React library, using Create React App (CRA) boilerplate.

The style was created with Styled Components, which helps to keep all styles isolated avoiding conflicts between components and pages.

The application has 3 pages:

- Home page - with the main information of the goal business of fictional company EXP|CON
- Pricing - Explanation about costs of each plan for the product on sale, in this case, live concerts tickets packages, as well as its perks
- Payment - Page with a form to insert user's personal and payment informations, in order to finish the purchase

The whole application is so far responsive for large (1920px width) and regular (1200px width) screens. The responsivity for tablets and smartphone can be implemented if required for the purpose of the assessment.

Due to relatively short deadline, I coudn't deal with all potential issues related to code reuse and abstraction. But in a general perpective the code of the code is clean and easily maintainable.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
